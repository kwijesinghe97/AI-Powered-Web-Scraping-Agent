I’m flying from New York to Bali on May 1, 2025, and returning on May 15, 2025. I’m looking for a budget-friendly hostel under $20 per night with WiFi and free breakfast. I prefer economy flights with layovers if it helps save money. During my stay, I’d love to explore Bali’s islands, go hiking, and experience the local street food.
